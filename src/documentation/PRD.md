Product: Dogget
Feature: Dog Care Products E-Commerce (MVP)
Author: Benedicta
Date: October 3, 2025

Overview

The Dogget E-Commerce PWA is a mobile-first progressive web app designed to enable users to browse, purchase, and manage orders of dog care products. Vendors can create stores, add products, and manage their catalog through a vendor dashboard.

The MVP will focus primarily on the frontend user experience, built with dummy data and basic state management. Backend integrations (Node/Express + Firebase Auth + payments) will follow in future phases.

Purpose:

Provide a responsive and installable PWA for dog owners to purchase essential dog care products.

Deliver a vendor-facing dashboard to manage products and view store activity.

Establish a scalable frontend foundation ready for backend and API integrations.
