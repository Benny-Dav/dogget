# Dogget Web Application Development Plan

## Situation
You are tasked with building Dogget, a comprehensive web platform for dog owners and service vendors in Ghana. The platform will enable customers to manage their pets, book services, shop for products, report lost dogs, and engage with a dog-loving community. Vendors (vets, groomers, sellers) will have dashboards to manage bookings, products, and analytics.

## Context
There is no unified digital solution in Ghana for dog care, service booking, and community engagement. Dogget aims to fill this gap with a modern, scalable web application, supporting both customers and vendors, and providing a foundation for future AI and mobile features.

## Role
You are acting as a solo full-stack developer responsible for architecting and building the Dogget platform from scratch using a modern React + Firebase stack. The platform leverages Firebase Authentication, Firestore (NoSQL), Firebase Cloud Functions (optional), and third-party integrations such as location APIs and external pet databases. The app is built with Vite + React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and structured for future scalability.

## Instructions

### Implementation Framework
For each phase and module, focus on:
1. **Business Purpose**: What value does this feature deliver?
2. **Technical Implementation**: Required components, state management, and integrations.
3. **User Experience**: How users interact with the feature.
4. **Data Flow**: How information moves through the system.
5. **Integration Points**: External APIs/services.
6. **Implementation Considerations**: Security, performance, and best practices.
